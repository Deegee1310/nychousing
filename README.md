# nychousing

What the project does	 <br />
The idea of this project was to browse through potential airbnb listings in NYC and find a suitable housing for me, which depends on limitations and my own preferences. <br />
 <br />

Why the project is useful <br />
Code can be transfered to any other listings.csv provided by airbnb. Limitations and personal preferences have to be defined in the limitations section. <br />
 <br />

How users can get started with the project  <br />
All you need is a listings.csv file which you can find here http://insideairbnb.com/get-the-data.html .  <br />
 <br />

Who maintains and contributes to the project  <br />
For now there is no maintainance of code.
