# nychousing

What the project does\n
The idea of this project was to browse through potential airbnb listings in NYC and find a suitable housing for me, which depends on limitations and my own preferences.\n
\n\n
Why the project is useful\n
Code can be transfered to any other listings.csv provided by airbnb. Limitations and personal preferences have to be defined in the limitations section.\n
\n\n
How users can get started with the project\n
All you need is a listings.csv file which you can find here http://insideairbnb.com/get-the-data.html .\n
\n\n
Who maintains and contributes to the project\n
For now there is no maintainance of code.\n
